# fire-detection-for-Surveillance-robot
Fire Flame Detection for Surveillance Robot ‚Äì A computer vision‚Äìbased system that detects fire flames in real time using deep learning and computer vision techniques. Designed as part of a surveillance robot project to enhance indoor safety and early fire hazard detection.

# üî• Fire Flame Detection for Surveillance Robot

This project implements a **fire detection system** using computer vision and machine learning techniques. It was designed as part of a **surveillance robot** that can monitor indoor environments and identify fire hazards in real time.

## üöÄ Project Overview
- Detects **fire flames** from video streams or camera input.
- Uses **deep learning** methods for robust detection.
- Provides **early warning capability** for fire hazards.
- Integrates with a **surveillance robot** to enhance indoor security.


## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- Real-time fire detection from live video feed or dataset.
- Preprocessing pipeline for robust detection under varying lighting.
- Model training and evaluation for reliable performance.
- Can be extended to work alongside **human motion detection** and other surveillance features.
